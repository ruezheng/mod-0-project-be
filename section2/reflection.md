## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
> - That becoming a programer helps you develop a growth mindset. Don't think you're not cut out to be a programmer because you're struggling, even 5 years into it. Wanting to find the answer is just something to lean into.
> - When you are struggling: 1. Don't panic. 2. Start read about the topic and search for the answer.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
> - I see why so many programmers love to climb! It's the same mindset - failure isn't bad, just a challenge to learn. The joy of climbing for me is in challenging myself to try routes that are more difficult than I have done before, especially if I don't think I can do it, but it's fun to try and see how far I get. Having the willingness to try something over and over and over until I get it is a mindset that will help me become a better programmer.

> - Being afraid to ask questions on the Slack channel because I'm worried people will think it's a "dumb" question. Coding is collaborative and not asking questions is limiting my ability to learn more efficiently.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
> Conditional statements execute commands by evaluating whether a statement is true or false.
> - If the egg yolk is yellow, it taste good.
> - If water is equal to or below 32 degrees F, it turns to ice.
> - If there is noise or light, I can't sleep.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
> - To respond to input from the user. e.g. When logging in, if a password is incorrect the conditional will return a "Forgot password?" link.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
variable = "text or number"
  if variable == "string"
    puts "string"
  else
    puts "string"
  end


```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
```
variable = "text or number"
  if variable == "string"
    puts "string"
  elsif variable == "string"
    puts "string"
  else
    puts "string"
  end


```

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
today = Tuesday
  if today == "Tuesday"
    puts "You are correct!"
  elsif today == "Sunday" || "Monday" || "Wednesday" || "Thursday" || "Friday" || "Saturday"
    puts "That is not today."
  else
    puts "Try again."
  end
```
