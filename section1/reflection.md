## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to do both. I ask questions before looking up the answer myself, and also I wait to long before asking or decide it's not important to ask.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
print "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
#### # hash or pound

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
#### Integer is a whole number (2). Float has a decimal point (2.0)

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
#### animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
#### p animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
#### Interpolation is used to stick the data stored in a variable inside of a string.
#### animal = "zebra"
#### p "Look over there! There's a #{animal} crossing the road!"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
#### gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
